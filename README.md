# diabetes_rfc_pred
Ongoing project for building a Random Forest Classifier for diabetes.

Diabetes is a significant global health issue that affects millions of people. Early detection and intervention can significantly improve health outcomes and quality of life. This model aims to provide a straightforward method for assessing diabetes risk using easily obtainable lifestyle data, such as:
- Age
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Physical activity level
- Dietary habits
- Etc.

Data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/data

This is an ongoing project that I am completing throughout the Fall semester.
